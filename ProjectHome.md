# Ensemble Framework for Gesture Recognition #

## Project Summary ##

Recognition in any domain is difficult. The advent of "Ensemble" techniques have made the fields of machine learning and machine vision tractable in that weak classifiers, when combined, are proven to enhance the correctness of recognition tasks over a single classifier system.

Here, I define "tractable" as being able to use computationally inexpensive algorithms in combination, allowing for higher recognition accuracy over a larger, computationally expensive algorithm.

INCA, "I've No Cute Acronym", was originally conceived by Dr. Gary Newell of the Northern Kentucky University as part of his PhD thesis while at the Arizona State University in 1995. The frame work here develops the INCA methodology into a working platform for ensemble techniques in gesture recognition domains.

ELAR, Ensemble Learning And Recognition, is a Java based framework for ensemble construction and testing with client/server modularity. Multimodal input with plug-n-play algorithm modularity.
